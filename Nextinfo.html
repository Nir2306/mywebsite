	    <p class="indent">
		    The butterfly and moth develop through a process called metamorphosis. This is a Greek word 
	        that means transformation or change in shape.Insects have two common types of metamorphosis. 
	        Grasshoppers, crickets, dragonflies, and cockroaches have incomplete metamorphosis. The young 
	        (called a nymph) usually look like small adults but without the wings.Butterflies, moths, beetles, 
	        flies and bees have complete metamorphosis. The young (called a larva instead of a nymph) is very 
	        different from the adults. It also usually eats different types of food.
		</p>

        <p>There are four stages in the metamorphosis of butterflies and moths: egg, larva, pupa, and adult.</p>

		    <p>
			    Eggs are laid on plants by the adult female butterfly. These plants will then become the food 
		        for the hatching caterpillars.Eggs can be laid from spring, summer or fall. This depends on the 
		        species of butterfly. Females lay a lot of eggs at once so that at least some of them survive.
                Butterfly eggs can be very small.

            <p>
			    The next stage is the larva. This is also called a caterpillar if the insect is a butterfly or a moth.
                The job of the caterpillar is to eat and eat and eat. As the caterpillar grows it splits its skin and 
		        sheds it about 4 or 5 times. Food eaten at this time is stored and used later as an adult.Caterpillars 
		        can grow 100 times their size during this stage. For example, a monarch butterfly egg is the size of a 
		        pinhead and the caterpillar that hatches from this tiny egg isn't much bigger. But it will grow up to 2 
		        inches long in several weeks.
