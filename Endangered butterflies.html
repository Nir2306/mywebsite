		    The main reason for these butterflies being placed under the Endangered Species Act
	        is mainly due to loss of habitat (agriculture, commercial, residential). However, other reasons include: 
	        poor land management practices, excessive use of pesticides and herbicides, and loss of the butterfly's 
	        host plant that is necessary for it's growth and development.

	    <p class="indent">
		    If faced with the risk of extinction, any species can be put under the protection of the Endangered 
	        Species Act (ESA). They are placed either as "threatened" and "endangered". To clarify those two terms: 
	        an “endangered” species is one that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of
	        its range. A “threatened” species is one that could become endangered in the near future. It isn’t alone. 
	        Our team of 28 scientists identified the 26 Australian butterfly species and subspecies at greatest risk 
	        of extinction. We also estimated the probability that they will be lost within 20 years.
