		    <p>
			    When the caterpillar is full grown and stops eating, it becomes a pupa. The pupa of butterflies is also called a chrysalis.
                Depending on the species, the pupa may suspended under a branch, hidden in leaves or buried underground. The pupa of many 
		        moths is protected inside a coccoon of silk.This stage can last from a few weeks, a month or even longer. Some species have
		        a pupal stage that lasts for two years.It may look like nothing is going on but big changes are happening inside. Special 
		        cells that were present in the larva are now growing rapidly. They will become the legs, wings, eyes and other parts of the 
		        adult butterfly. Many of the original larva cells will provide energy for these growing adult cells.

            <p>
			    The adult stage is what most people think of when they think of butterflies. They look very different from the larva. 
		        The caterpillar has a few tiny eyes, stubby legs and very short antennae. The adults have long legs, long antennae, and 
		        compound eyes. They can also fly by using their large and colorful wings. The one thing they can't do is grow.The caterpillar's 
		        job was to eat. The adult's job is to mate and lay eggs. Some species of adult butterflies get energy by feeding on nectar from 
		        flowers but many species don't feed at all.Flying comes in handy. The adult female can easily fly from place to place to find the 
		        right plant for its eggs. This is important because caterpillars can't travel far.Most adult butterflies live only one or two weeks, 
		        but some species hibernate during the winter and may live several months.
