            <p>Butterflies are insects in the macrolepidopteran clade Rhopalocera from the order Lepidoptera, which also includes 
               moths.The group comprises the large superfamily Papilionoidea, which contains numerous species of insects belonging 
               to multiple families. Butterflies, along with the moths and the skippers, make up the insect order Lepidoptera. 
               Butterflies are nearly worldwide in their distribution. Butterflies are often polymorphic, and many species make use 
               of camouflage, mimicry, and aposematism to evade their predators. Some, like the monarch and the painted lady, migrate 
               over long distances. Many butterflies are attacked by parasites or parasitoids, including wasps, protozoans, flies, and 
               other invertebrates, or are preyed upon by other organisms.Some species are pests because in their larval stages they can
		       damage domestic crops or trees; other species are agents of pollination of some plants.

		    <p>Butterflies are distributed worldwide except Antarctica, totalling some 18,500 species. Of these, 775 are 
               Nearctic; 7,700 Neotropical; 1,575 Palearctic; 3,650 Afrotropical; and 4,800 are distributed across the combined Oriental 
               and Australian/Oceania regions. The monarch butterfly is native to the Americas, but in the nineteenth century or before, 
               spread across the world, and is now found in Australia, New Zealand, other parts of Oceania, and the Iberian Peninsula. It is 
               not clear how it dispersed; adults may have been blown by the wind or larvae or pupae may have been accidentally transported 
               by humans, but the presence of suitable host plants in their new environment was a necessity for their successful establishment.
